# Other technologies worth exploring

The following technologies were not explored because of time and/or money constraints.

## tracking.js
tracking.js is an open-source library for real-time tracking of colors, face detection, and many other things. 

## webRTC
WebRTC enables real time communication through the web. We had too little time to get it to work on our meeting app.

## 8th Wall (paid)
8th Wall provides tools for World Tracking, Face Effects and Image Target AR experiences on the web. It seems promising for placing objects in the real world without markers or GPS. This toolset costs money to use.

## networked-aframe
Networked-Aframe is a framework for writing multi-user VR apps in A-frame. It supports WebRTC and looks promising to use for VR meetings. Sadly, we found this framework too late, and did not have time to try and implement it.
